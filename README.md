This Rock Paper Scissors project in JavaScript typically involves  a web-based game where a player competes against a computer opponent. The game utilizes HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the game logic and interactive elements.


Key features and functionalities include:
Player Input: Users select "rock," "paper," or "scissors" via clickable buttons or other interactive elements.
Computer Choice: The computer's choice is generated randomly using JavaScript's Math.random() function.
Game Logic: JavaScript code determines the winner of each round based on the classic Rock Paper Scissors rules (rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock).
Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the player's and computer's scores, updating them after each round.
Displaying Results: The game provides visual feedback, indicating the choices made by both the player and the computer, and announcing the winner of each round and the overall game.
Reset Functionality: A reset option allows players to start a new game at any time.
User Interface: The project often incorporates a visually appealing and responsive user interface, potentially including animations or visual representations of the choices.
